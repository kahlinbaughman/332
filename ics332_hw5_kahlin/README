Exercise 1
    Question 1:
        q1:
            Job B would be the most likely to be the infinite CPU burst.
            It seems to use the whole time quantum repeatedly except for one instance.

        q2:
            Job A.

        q3:
            Job A is most likely to be the text editor since it seems to be constantly waiting for I/O.

    Question 2:
        q1:
            IoIoIo IoCCo IoIoIo IoCCo

        q3:
            cumulative time o = 1ms
            total time = 13ms
            1/13 * 100 = 7%
            x/13*100 = 2%
            x/13 = 2/100
            x = (13*2)100
            x = 0.26ms
            o takes .026ms to get 2%
