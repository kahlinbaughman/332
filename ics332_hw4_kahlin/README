Exercise #1

Q1.
	I found that a graph size of 168 will run the program at 27s consistently.

Q3.
	1: 28.636
	2: 15.57
	3: 16.0248
	4: 15.9014
	5: 15.951
	6: 15.8696
	7: 16.126
	8: 16.5276
	9: 16.4524
	10: 16.8124

	q1.
		It is .54x faster than running on one thread
		15.57/28.636 = .54
	q2.
		Two
	q3.
		No. More threads than cores on my machine actually seems to make it worse.
	q4.
		The largest acceleration factor is .54 with 2 threads.
