Exercise #1:
    Question #1:
        The heap allocator allocates new chunks of ram at the end of holes in
        memory. If it was allocated at the beginning then the address would
        have been 2112.

    Question #2:
             Free          Free          Free          Free
    0  | 1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
       0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8
    --------------
    The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 2524
        Can't be best Fit cause would have gone to address 3676
    The 200-byte chunk was allocated at address 2324
    The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 2224
    The 80-byte chunk was allocated at address 3696
        Can't be First Fit because would have gone at address 2144

        It is worst fit because they filled up the biggest hole first when
        others were available.


    Question #3
       1024   64   1024    512   1024    128   1024    64    1024
             Free          Free          Free          Free
    0 |  1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
      0       1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8
    --------------
    The 40-byte chunk was allocated at address 3736
        Can't be first or best fit or it would have chosen address 1048
        Can't be worst fit or it would have chosen address 2584
    The 400-byte chunk was allocated at address 2224
    The 80-byte chunk was allocated at address 2144
    The 60-byte chunk was allocated at address 4804

        It is none of the above.


    Question #4
    Answer:
                64            512           128            64
                Free          Free          Free          Free
        0 | 1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
          0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8
        --------------
        The 400-byte chunk was allocated at address 2224
        The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 3676
        The 10-byte chunk was allocated at address 2214
        The 10-byte chunk was allocated at address 2204
