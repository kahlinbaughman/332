Exercise #1:
    Question #1:
        The heap allocator allocates new chunks of ram at the end of holes in
        memory. If it was allocated at the beginning then the address would
        have been 2112.

    Question #2:
    1024, 64,  1024,   512,  1024,   128,  1024,     64, 1024
    0  | 1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
    --------------
    The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 2524
    The 200-byte chunk was allocated at address 2324
    The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 2224
    The 80-byte chunk was allocated at address 3696

        Answer:
            It can't be first fit otherwise the the 100-byte chunk would allocate to
                924.
            It can't be best fit otherwise the 100-byte chunk would allocate to
                3676.
            It can't be worst fit due to the 200 byte allocating to address 2324
                which isn't the biggest hole available.

            It must be using none of the above.

    Question #3
    1024   64   1024    512   1024    128   1024    64    1024
    0 |  1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
    --------------
    The 40-byte chunk was allocated at address 3736
    The 400-byte chunk was allocated at address 2224
    The 80-byte chunk was allocated at address 2144
    The 60-byte chunk was allocated at address 4804

        Answer:
            40-byte chunk goes to the 128 chunk
                Can't be best fit
            60-byte chunk goes to the second 64 bit chunk
                Can't be first fit
            400 and 80 byte chunk go to the 512 chunk
                Can't be worst fit

            It must be using none of the above

    Question #4
    Answer:
        0 | 1024 | 1088 | 2112 | 2624 | 3648 | 3776 | 4800 | 4864 |
        --------------
        The 400-byte chunk was allocated at address 624
        The 100-byte chunk was allocated at address 2012
        The 10-byte chunk was allocated at address 3638
        The 10-byte chunk was allocated at address 4790
