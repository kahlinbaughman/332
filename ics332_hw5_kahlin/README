Exercise 1
    Question 1:
        q1:
            Job B would be the most likely to be the infinite CPU burst.
            It seems to use the whole time quantum repeatedly except for one instance.

        q2:
            Job A.

        q3:
            Job A is most likely to be the text editor since it seems to be constantly waiting for I/O.

    Question 2:
        q1:
            IoIoIo IoCCo IoIoIo IoCCo

        q3:
            cumulative time o = 1ms
            total time = 13ms
            1/13 * 100 = 7%
            x/13*100 = 2%
            x/13 = 2/100
            x = (13*2)100
            x = 0.26ms
            o takes .026ms to get 2%

Exercise 2
    high 4ms
    mid  8ms
    low  20ms
    Question 1:
        B-2,
        A-4,
        D-8,
        C-7,
        E-20
        q1:
            Job A is in the mid priority queue.
            Job B is in the high priority queue.
            Job C is in the mid priority queue.
            Job D is in the low priority queue.
            Job E is in the low priority queue.

        q2:
            0123 45 6789 0123
            AAAA BB CCCC DDDD EEEE

            D gets put into the mid priority queue at time 13. It uses the whole
            time quantum and runs from time 10 to 13. After it finishes running
            it gets dropped to the mid priority queue.

    Question2:
        A-2, B-âˆž
        q1:
            AA BBBB AA B AA B...

        q2:
            Yes. It runs 33% of the time. If take the pattern longer, say
            five repetitions of "AA B AA B"then A runs for total of 20ms and
            B does total of 10ms. 10/30 *100 = 33

        q3:
            01 2345 67 8 90 1 23 4567 89 0 12 3 45 6789 01 2 34 5 67 89
            AA BBBB AA B AA B AA BBBB AA B AA B AA BBBB AA B AA B AA BB...
